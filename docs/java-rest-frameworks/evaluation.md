# Java Based REST framework evaluation

## Introduction
It's always hard to know which is the 'best' framework to use for a task. This is a problem I faced with one
of my clients recently when we had to justify our choice of REST framework. Hopefully this page will help you 
choose the 'best' for your organisation.
 
The aim of this evaluation was to get a simple REST service up and running as quickly as possible in each of the above 
frameworks. Using this I can get a feel for which of the frameworks I like the most.

## Frameworks to evaluate (in alphabetical order)

### [DropWizard](dropwizard.md)
### [JHipster](jhipster.md)
### [RestEasy](resteasy.md)
### [Spark](spark.md)
### [SpringBoot](springboot.md)
### [Vert.x](vertx.md)


## A summary of my findings: [Conclusion](conclusion.md)
