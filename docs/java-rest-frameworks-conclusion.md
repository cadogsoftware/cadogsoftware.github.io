### Conclusion

I have quickly investigated several java REST frameworks. My aim was to get something running quickly in each of these 
so I limited myself to a small amount of time on each.
Here is how I rank the frameworks in order of best to worst:

1. SpringBoot
2. Dropwizard
3. JHipster
4. Vert.x
5. Spark
6. RestEasy
