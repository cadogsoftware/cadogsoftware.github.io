## Let's get going...

### JHipster

JHipster was not on my original list of REST frameworks to trial, but it caught my eye when I was searching frameworks to evaluate. Here is an image of their website, outlining what you can do with it:

Whilst this seems to be more than just a REST framework I have included this in my trial as I was excited by the possibilities this seemed to offer.

In progress.....
